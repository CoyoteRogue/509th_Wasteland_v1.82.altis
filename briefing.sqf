----------------------------- Tips and Hints -----------------------------
<br/>
<br/>Ask any 509th member to help. We will gladly provide advice, cash/supplies and anything else needed to enjoy your time on our server.
<br/>
<br/>Most 509th members play on the Independent faction. Request an in-game invite via the 'Side' channel to be added to our group. Otherwise, you are fair game!
<br/>
<br/>Install the STGI and STNames mods to be able to spot 'friendly' players. Normal player markers are disabled. The 509th version of STGI and STNames (available on our website) has a greater view distance than the ShackTac version but both work on the server.
<br/>
<br/>Vehicles and items (including base parts) that are NOT locked will be removed at server reset.
<br/>
<br/>Vehicles not used in a 14 day period will be removed.
<br/>
<br/>You must enter the server every 90 days or you will start over from scratch. 
<br/>
<br/>Stay within the large blue circle on the map and below 4500m altitude or you will perish.
<br/>
<br/>Do not go AFK for more than 20 minutes or you will be kicked.
<br/>
<br/>At the start of the game, spread out and find supplies before worrying about where to establish a meeting place or a base, supplies are important and very valuable.
<br/>
<br/>When picking a base location, it is best advised to pick a place that is out of the way and not so obvious such as airports, cities, map-bound bases, etc. remember, players randomly spawn in and around towns and could even spawn inside your base should you set it up in a town.
<br/>
<br/>If you spawn in an area with no vehicles or supplies in the immediate area, DO NOT just click respawn from the pause menu, chances are if you search an area of a few hundred meters, you will find something.
<br/>
<br/>Always be on the lookout for nightvision goggles. They are located in the ammo crates, and there are pairs scattered throughout vehicles. You can also purchase them from the stores. Nighttime without them SUCKS, and if you have them, you can conduct stealth raids on enemy bases under the cover of complete darkness.
<br/>
<br/>When you set up a base, never leave your supplies unguarded, one guard will suffice, but it is recommended you have at least 2, maybe 3 guards at base at all times.
<br/>
<br/>There are very aggressive AI characters that spawn with most missions and will protect the mission objectives with deadly force, be aware of them.
<br/>
<br/>Keep your cash and other equipment in a well hidden and LOCKED Ammo Crate (buy them at the General Store). Locked Ammo Crates and purchased vehicles will return with you after you leave the game for up to 14 days.
<br/>
<br/>Look in towns for select blue trash barrels that allow you to HALO jump anywhere on the map.

---------------------------------- FAQ ----------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>Wasteland is a team versus team versus team sandbox survival experience. The objective of this mission is to rally your faction, scavenge supplies, weapons, and vehicles, and destroy the other factions. It is survival at its best!
<br/>
<br/>Q. What am I supposed to do here?
<br/>A. See the above description
<br/>
<br/>Q. Where can I get a gun?
<br/>A. Weapons are found in one of three places, first in ammo crates that come as rewards from missions; Second, in the gear section of the vehicles, which also randomly spawn around the map. The last place to find a gun would be at the gunshops located throughout the map. You can also find them on dead players whose bodies have not yet been looted.
<br/>
<br/>Q. What are the blue circles on the map?
<br/>A. The circles represent town limits. If friendly soldiers are in a town, you can spawn there from the re-spawn menu; however if there is an enemy presence, you will not be able to spawn there.
<br/>
<br/>Q. Why is it so dark, I cant see.
<br/>A. The server has a day/night cycle just like in the real world, and as such, night time is a factor in your survival. It is recommended that you find sources of light or use your Nightvision Goggles as the darkness sets in.
<br/>
<br/>Q. What's with the water bottles and food cans?
<br/>A. This game has a food and water system that you must adhere to or you will die. You can collect food cans and water bottles from buildings, or from items dropped by dead players. Food and water is also available at the General Stores for purchase.
<br/>
<br/>Q. What is an ATM (Automatic Teller Machine)?
<br/>A. ATMs are access points to your bank account. You may make cash deposits, withdraws and transfers to other players on your team. Don't walk around with too much cash on your person as you may get robbed.
<br/>
<br/>Q. Is it okay for me to shoot my team mates?
<br/>A. If you are member of BLUFOR or OPFOR teams, then you are NOT allowed to shoot or steal items and vehicles from other players. If you play as Independent, you are free to engage anyone as well as team up with anyone you want.
<br/>
<br/>Q. I saw someone breaking a rule, what do I do?
<br/>A. Simply go into global chat and get the attention of one of the admins or visit our forums at www.509th.net/forums, and make a report if the offense is serious. Visit www.509th.net for more information.
